interesting code:

//load saved game
CFG_SG_Manager.cs:
public static bool LoadSaveGameFile(string strFileName)

//code that reads the save file and load it
CFG_SG_Container.cs:
public bool LoadData(string FileName)

//takes an array and decodes it to generate
//the bytes of a xml file?
CFG_SG_Container.cs:
public static byte[] EncodeArray(byte[] arr, bool bSkipFirst)

//code to change the m_CurrentTargetPoint and limit to the map borders
CFGCamera.cs
private void Pan(Vector3 vector)
